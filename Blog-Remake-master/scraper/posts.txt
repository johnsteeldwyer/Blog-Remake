The Pre-Columbian\u00a0ruins are genuine and nestled within several spectacular protective Andean peaks\u00a0(namely Huayna and Machu). Post-visit, it\u2019s clear\u00a0why it\u2019s considered a \u201cmust-see\u201d and one of the world\u2019s seven wonders.\u00a0 The Government and supporting tourist\u00a0infrastructure in the adjacent pueblo\u00a0of Agua Calientes does an excellent job managing access to the site, maintaining its integrity, and\u00a0ensuring the throngs of visitors\u00a0have an enjoyable and memorable visit. \u00a0</p><p>The \u201cNew Inca Gold\u201d referred to above is the fact that while a visit to Machu Picchu should be on any world traveler\u2019s bucket list, it\u2019s going to cost you to get there.\u00a0 I calculate the minimum for a day trip out of Cusco is close to $400 US a person, largely due to the professional management of and remote natural isolation of the site. The obscure\u00a0location was likely the attraction when Machu Picchu was originally constructed as a retreat for the Inca Emperor Pachacuti 550\u00a0years ago and why it wasn\u2019t rediscovered until 1914. There are no modern roads to Machu Picchu, you arrive only via mountain train or by hiking (Inca Trail) and both are strictly controlled and chaperoned costing\u00a0anywhere between $180 \u2013 $1500 US. \u00a0\u00a0If you choose the train, you\u2019re dropped\u00a0in the pueblo of Aguas Calientes at the base of the site with food/water options ($50). The recommendation is to make the visit a two-day trip, get a hotel for the night and not rush\u00a0($100). From Aguas, you then board a bus ($50 US round trip) up to the ruins that cover the 10 km of vertical switchbacks leading to the site\u2019s main gate. Once there, another $25 US to enter the Machu Picchu site, with a specific time of entrance as well as areas permitted to visit as a maximum of 4000 tourists\u00a0are allowed\u00a0each day. 4000 people times $400 ++\u00a0each per day and Kha Ching! My guess is that Pizzaro and the Conquistadors never pulled that kind of wealth from the place. On the other hand, the high cost of the visit\u00a0also seemed to keep the riff raft and nick knacks that pollute other famous travel destinations to a bare minimum which made for a memorable trip indeed. You get what you pay for. Advice is to read some history before the trip, don\u2019t waste money hiring a site \u201cguide\u201d and get in shape for the climbing.  </p>", "captions": "Inca Princess//Pizzaro//Machu Picchu//Inca Royal Palace//Huayna Picchu//Aguas Calientes//"}, {"id": 29, "date": "15-07-2022", "title": "The Tail of the Dragon\u00a02022", "subtitle": "Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee \u2013 Best Bike Routes in the East", "categories": "Appalachia//Bike trip//Harley Davidson Road KIng//", "content": "<p>For the second time in 12 months, I decided to head north with the Road King through 8 States and 2,954 miles in search of America\u2019s best motorcycle routes.

El Chalten, nestled into the Andes and host to Mt. Fitz Roy and Las\u00a0Torres, is surely the money shot for any\u00a0Patagonia experience. The goal line for me was to visit the \u201cLaguna De Los Tres\u201d or the glacial lake at the foot of Mt. Fitz Roy. This 16-mile hike starts in the village of El Chalten and climbs more than 2300 feet, with the last mile accounting\u00a0for more than half the altitude. You can\u2019t really go to El Chalten and not visit\u00a0Laguna De Los Torres, or so the promotional literature goes. I then started looking on the internet for some guides and tour companies to facilitate the trip. All kinds of packages of course, but all with the same caveat, no one could join the hike if \u201cover the age of 50\u201d due to its\u00a0physical demands. \u00a0That\u2019s one thing I love about the Third World, honesty. Be it in Thailand where advertisements clearly state that no women/men over the age of 25 need apply for the Thai Airlines Steward vacancies, Trekking companies in Argentina were upfront that they weren\u2019t going to haul any\u00a0over 50 asses up the side of the mountain.\u00a0</p><p>Screw that, I\u2019m 61 and had expended a lot of effort just to get down into this part of the world, so I\u2019ll do it on my own. I\u2019d put in a lot of miles getting in shape in the weeks leading up to the visit. However, on the other hand, doubt existed as those weeks had been spent in Brasil and I\u2019d been enjoying the Cerveja and Bife a vontage. I hit the trail at daybreak as Katia had let me loose for the day. My\u00a0plan was to\u00a0start the trek without expectations, see how far I could go, then turn and come home without regret.

Halfway there, easy decision, I was going to man the fuck up and finish this. Truth is the hike is not that difficult if you\u2019re in any kind of shape, but that last mile/climb is certainly a bitch, especially in a foot of snow. Well worth the effort as the show the lake revealed is\u00a0something you\u2019ll never forget. Personally, I thought the trek to Laguna Torre the day before with my wife Katia was as\u00a0scenic and enjoyable as there are really no bad hikes\u00a0in that part of the world.

Thessaloniki was Greece\u2019s \u201cSecond City\u201d, there was Macedonia in the north and Meteora and its monasteries in the middle. Looks good I thought, why not? We hit the road to see them all. Plenty of time to burn in each location which meant slower routines,\u00a0time to wander, and new curiosity\u00a0to find less obvious culinary delights and\u00a0attractions. Instead of renting hotel rooms for a few days, I\u2019m renting Airbnb apartments for a few weeks in previously unknown\u00a0locations.

He was a long time resident of Geneva, New York, and Palm Bay, Florida and will be remembered as a wonderful father, grandfather, husband, and friend.</p><p>Born in Geneva in 1935, Al attended Geneva High School and subsequently graduated from Nichols College in Dudley, Massachusetts. Following his schoolboy athletic career, he was signed by the Detroit Tigers Baseball organization as a pitcher where he played for several clubs throughout the late \u201950s. Most notably, he pitched the winning game to secure the Carolina League Championship for the 1957 Durham Bulls. Al was later inducted into the Nichols College Hall of Fame in 1986, the Geneva Sports Hall of Fame in 1998 and honored by the Durham Bulls on the 50th anniversary of the championship season in Durham, North Carolina in 2007. Following baseball, Al remained an athlete and competitor and was a nationally ranked Racquetball player throughout the \u201980s and \u201990s.</p><p>In 1959, Al married his Geneva sweetheart Katharine \u201cKay\u201d Bullock, who together raised two sons and recently celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary. Al retired in 1996 from International Business Machines (IBM) in Burlington, Vermont. \u201cDad\u201d was always a role model for his two boys who will remember him most for his devotion and having never missed a single game in either of their own schoolboy athletic careers. In 1996, Al and Kay retired to Palm Bay, Florida where they enjoyed spending time together traveling the globe, helping to raise their grandchildren and being part of the local community.</p><p>Al is survived by his wife Kay Dwyer, his two sons Alan Jr. and Arthur, his daughter-in-law Katia and three grandsons, John, Caio, and Alan 3rd.

(Delil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)</p><p>Opinion by\u00a0David Ignatius</p><p>Columnist</p><p>July 3, 2017</p><p>TABQA, Syria</p><p>For this Independence Day, at a moment when the tone of our political life would probably shame our Founders, here are snapshots of some brave American soldiers and civilians I met inside Syria last week who should make us all proud.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with a bearded sergeant major from Oklahoma. He\u2019s driving an armored SUV down a dusty road toward Tabqa. He\u2019s got a radio headset on to talk to the other vehicles in the convoy, but he\u2019s playing country music from a speaker up front, too.</p><p>The sergeant major weaves the vehicle around ruts and potholes. Islamic State fighters who controlled the town until six weeks ago like to pack the potholes with explosives. Most mines have been cleared, but still, it\u2019s not a ride in the park.</p><p>As the vehicle bumps along, the sergeant major talks about a comrade who was killed about 40 miles north of here last November by an improvised explosive device in a house.\u00a0Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Scott C. Dayton\u00a0was assigned to defuse such ordnance. It\u2019s said he died trying to shield U.S. and Syrian partner soldiers from the blast. So far, miraculously, he\u2019s the only American who has died in combat in Syria as the U.S. and its allies have routed the Islamic State from town after town.</p><p>The sergeant major drives these roads near Raqqa every day. He\u2019s part of a Special Operations forces team that is advising the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that is clearing the Islamic State from its capital, training a separate internal security force that will maintain security after the terrorist group is gone, and supporting the local civic councils that will rebuild water, electricity, schools and other services. He\u2019s one of about 500 U.S. Special Operations forces now serving in Syria; the first 50 arrived about 18 months ago.</p><p>Sometimes these roads are crowded with desperate refugees fleeing the battle with their families, carrying furniture and, occasionally, herding livestock. The sergeant major calls it \u201cgoatlock,\u201d with so many sheep and goats blocking the road,</p><p>The Syria mission is usually secret, little seen or understood by the American public. But these anonymous warriors are some of the best soldiers I\u2019ve encountered anywhere. They\u2019re living rough, in forward outposts in the towns and in a few simple bases in the countryside. Working alongside their Syrian partners, they\u2019re accomplishing something U.S. forces haven\u2019t experienced enough over the past two decades: They\u2019re winning.</p><p>\u201cThe best fighters in the world are the ones who are trying to get home,\u201d explains a Special Operations forces commander who runs training for the Syrian security troops who will protect Raqqa and the surrounding towns as the Islamic State collapses. He plans to graduate 250 trainees every two weeks, building toward a force of 3,500 to 5,000. This is\u00a0very\u00a0basic training. I listened to a rangy American soldier bark out to the Syrian recruits through a translator, \u201cHow to shoot: There are five positions.\u201d The recruits paid rapt attention, as if understanding that their instructor represented the best fighting force in the world.</p><p>Like every soldier I met, the sergeant major is passionate about his mission. I ask him how many Islamic State fighters were killed in Tabqa. \u201cNot enough,\u201d he answers. \u201cThe worst thing anyone could ever do when they\u2019re on our bad side is to give themselves a ZIP code,\u201d he says. The \u201ccaliphate\u201d made that mistake.</p><p>When these soldiers finish business, they go back to camps that are simple, to put it mildly. This is not the \u201cGreen Zone\u201d occupation life, with three choices of entree. If you\u2019re not ready to deal with regular digestive-tract problems, stay away. Like American soldiers everywhere, they\u2019re super-fit. Nearly every facility has a makeshift gym, and you find men and women pumping iron morning and night.</p><p>These elite units are the pride of the U.S. military. The forces I saw were the train-and-assist part of the mission. But there is another, super-secret part of the Special Operations forces mission here that seeks to capture or kill extremists. What they all share is toughness and good judgment.</p><p>Not all the American heroes I saw here are soldiers. Al Dwyer, the chief coordinator of emergency relief assistance, illustrates what civilians are doing. Dwyer, a USAID official, has led every major American humanitarian mission in recent years, from the 2010 Haiti earthquake to the 2014 Ebola breakout in West Africa. He is a stone-cold pro at the logistics of assisting desperate people.</p><p>How did Dwyer get started in the humanitarian-aid world? It\u2019s a basic American story. He was running a freight terminal in Boston when someone gave him an order he thought was inappropriate, and he decided: Take this job and shove it. He has worked in 100 countries since then, helping people survive. It\u2019s Americans such as Dwyer and the sergeant major who I\u2019m thinking about this Fourth of July week.</p><p>Read more from\u00a0David Ignatius\u2019s archive,\u00a0follow him on Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0subscribe to his updates on Facebook.</p><p>Read more about this topic</p><p>David Ignatius: As the Islamic State falls in Syria, one city offers a preview of the country\u2019s future</p>", "captions": "None//"}, {"id": 6, "date": "11-07-2012", "title": "BKK- Chumphon Bike Trip Day\u00a02", "subtitle": "", "categories": "Bike Trip//Locations//Thailand//", "content": "<p>Prachuap Khan KhiriTime 4:27 min: 62.16 miles:13.19 avg: from Hua HimFirst flat, lucky I was in town and found a bike shop,\u00a0 Guy had2 tubes my size and bought them both.Temp 31, impossible to ride much after 1pm due to the heat.\u00a0 Thank God I\u00a0 bought sunscreen\u2026\u2026</p><p>Road (Route 4 South) shoulder is very good and clean.
